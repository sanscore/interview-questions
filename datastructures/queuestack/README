Q) Create a Queue implemented with a Stack.

A) 
Notes:
  Queues are a FIFO structure
  Stacks are a LIFO structure
  To create a Queue with a Stack Implentation you need to somehow either:
    a) pop() an element from the bottom of the Stack, or
    b) push() an element to the bottom of the Stack
  To accomplish this choose to either the enqueue or the dequeue method to
    apply the correction.
  With dequeue, pop() each stack element onto a new, temporary Stack. Once the
    Stack is emptied, pop() the first element form the temp Stack and save it 
    as the return value. pop() the remaining elements from the temp Stack back
    to the permanent Stack using the push() method. Finally, return the saved 
    element.
  With enqueue, the process would be the same except you would push the new
    element onto the permanent Stack once it is emptied; saving the return 
    value. Then empty the temp Stack onto the permanent Stack.:
